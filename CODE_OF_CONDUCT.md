# Code of Conduct

We want Alloy to be a place where people feel welcome to collaborate. That means:

- Treat everyone with respect and curiosity, even when you disagree.
- Assume good intent, communicate clearly, and give constructive feedback.
- Offensive, harassing, or exclusionary behavior will not be tolerated.

If you see behavior that violates this spirit, please contact the maintainers or open a private issue so we can address it quickly.

In short: be excellent to each other. Jerks need not apply.
