# What is Alloy?

Alloy is a Vite plugin for **compile-time dependency injection**.

It scans your code at build time to build a dependency graph and generates a DI container, which is then available to your application as a virtual module. This approach minimizes runtime overhead, avoids `reflect-metadata`, and provides a clean, declarative API for managing your services.

## Why Alloy?

Traditional DI frameworks configure containers at runtime and often rely on `reflect-metadata` (which adds bloat and runtime cost) or require verbose manual registration.

Alloy shifts resolution to **build time**:

- **Zero Runtime Reflection:** No metadata emission required.
- **Minimal Overhead:** The container is just a map of factories generated by the bundler.
- **Explicit Lazy Loading:** First-class support for code-splitting via `Lazy()`.
- **Type Safe:** Generates type definitions for service identifiers automatically.
